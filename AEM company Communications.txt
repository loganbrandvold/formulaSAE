Hello!

I am on Oklahoma State Universities Formula SAE team. We bought Infinity Series-3 recently and my job is to display information from the Infinity received via CAN. Looking through the technical docs all I can find is the pins relating to high and low and a note saying to contact you for more information. Could you please inform me of the following information:

Do you use J1939?
What are the IDs and descriptions of the messages being sent via CAN?
What speed does the bus operate at?
Are there any remote transmission requests sent by the  Infinity?

Thank you so much for the help!
